                 <h4>About</h4>

                 <p>"AndroidPreferenceActivity" is an Android-library, which provides an alternative implementation of the Android SDK's built-in <tt>PreferenceActivity</tt>. Such an activity provides a visualization of categorized preferences. The appearance of the activity varies depending on the size of the device's display. On devices with small screens, e.g. on smartphones, the navigation is designed to use the whole available space and selecting an item causes the corresponding preferences to be shown full screen as well. On devices with large screens, e.g. on tablets, the navigation and the preferences of the currently selected item are shown split screen instead. Although the library's API is 
designed to be similar to the API of the Android SDK's PreferenceActivity, it provides additional possibilities, beyond the functionalities of the original. This includes easier adaption of the activity's appearance, as well as the possibility to use the activity as a wizard and to add or remove the activity's preference headers dynamically at runtime. The screenshot below illustrate the default appearance of the activity, which is provided by the library, on a tablet.</p>

                 <p>The screenshots below show the appearance of the library's <tt>PreferenceActivity</tt> when used on a smartphone:</p>

                 <p>The aim of this documentation is to offer an overview of the project's source code and to explain, how the interface, which is provided by the library, can be used and how the underlying implementations are supposed to work.</p>            

                <p>The library provides the following features:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The activity's navigation allows to show preference headers, which categorize the preferences of a <tt>PreferenceFragment</tt>. Furthermore, regular fragments can be shown. Besides a title, the preference headers may contain an icon and a summary and it is possible to launch an intent when a header is selected.</li>
                    <li>The activity's preference headers can be defined via XML resources, which are compatible to the ones used to initialize the Android SDK's built-in <tt>PreferenceActivity</tt>. Alternatively, the preference headers can be added or removed dynamically at runtime, which causes the current selected preference header to be adapted automatically.</li>
                    <li>The activity provides methods, which easily allow to access its child views in order to manipulate their appearance. For the most common manipulations even dedicated methods exist.</li>
                    <li>The library allows to override the behavior of the action bar's back button in  order to use it for navigating on devices with a small screen.</li>
                    <li>It is possible to launch the activity using an intent, which specifies the preference header, which should be initially selected. Such an intent also allows to hide the navigation.</li>
                    <li>By specifying appropriate intent extras, it is also possible to use the activity as a wizard, which provides an alternative navigation, which allows to navigate from one step of the wizard to an other. The navigation can be observed and influenced by implementing and registering an appropriate listener.</li>
                </ul>
