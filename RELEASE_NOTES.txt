Version: 		1.0.0 
Release date:	10.19.2014
--------------------------

The first stable release, which provides an activity, an alternative implementation of
the Android SDK's built-in PreferenceActivity. The implementation initially provides the 
following features:
	
    -   The activity's navigation allows to show preference headers, which categorize the
        preferences of a PreferenceFragment. Furthermore, regular Fragments can be shown.
        Besides a title, the preference headers may contain an icon and a summary and it
        is possible to launch an intent when a header is selected.
        
    -   The activity's preference headers can be defined via XML resources, which are compatible 
        to the ones used to initialize the Android SDK's built-in PreferenceActivity. 
        Alternatively, the preference headers can be added or removed dynamically at runtime, 
        which causes the current selected preference header to be adapted automatically.
        
    -   The activity provides methods, which easily allow to access its child views in
        order to manipulate their appearance. For the most common manipulations even 
        dedicated methods are provided.
        
    -   The library allows to override the behavior of the action bar's back button in
        order to use it for navigating on devices with a small screen.
    
    -   It is possible to launch the activity using an intent, which specifies the preference
        header, which should be initially selected. Such an intent also allows to hide the
        navigation.
        
    -   By specifying appropriate intent extras, it is also possible to use the activity as a
        wizard, which provides an alternative navigation, which allows to navigate from one
        step of the wizard to an other. The navigation can be observed and influenced by 
        implementing and registering an appropriate listener.

    -   The Preference is visually-consistent with Android's built-in PreferenceActivity.
